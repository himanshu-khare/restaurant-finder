1. Uses the mocki API to create fake API to get cities and restaurants list
2. Add the 50 Indian cities data in the API and 10 restaurants in the API not related to the city
3. Test cases are not written don't get the time and I also do not feel like writing it UI is simple and handled error handling in API and UI
4. Uses the MVC repository design pattern
